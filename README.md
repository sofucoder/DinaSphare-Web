Methodology

The development of this software will follow the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) methodology. This approach is ideal for building scalable, maintainable, and reusable systems. The key reasons for using OOP in this project include:

Modularity: OOP allows for breaking down the system into smaller, manageable objects that represent real-world entities such as Customer, Cafe Owner, Menu Item, Order, and Feedback. Each object will have its own attributes (data) and methods (functions), making the code more organized and modular.

Reusability: Through inheritance and polymorphism, components such as menu management and feedback systems can be reused across different parts of the application. This reduces redundancy and improves efficiency in development.

Maintainability: OOP facilitates better code maintainability and scalability. Changes or updates to one part of the system (e.g., adding a new type of food item or modifying a customer feedback process) can be made without affecting other parts of the system.

Encapsulation: OOP allows the encapsulation of data and functions within objects, ensuring that internal details of the software are hidden from other parts of the system. This improves security and reduces complexity for developers working on different parts of the system.

Flexibility and Extensibility: With OOP, new features (e.g., additional food categories, user accounts) can be added with minimal changes to the existing codebase, allowing for easy future enhancements.

Key OOP Principles to be Applied:

Classes and Objects: Represent entities like customers, cafe owners, menu items, orders, and feedback.

Inheritance: Allow for shared functionality across objects, such as common attributes or behaviors (e.g., all types of orders having a status).

Polymorphism: Enable different forms of interactions, such as processing various types of orders (dine-in, delivery) with the same interface.

Abstraction: Hide the complex logic behind simple interfaces for ease of use by developers and users.

By utilizing the OOP methodology, this project ensures that the software will be both efficient and adaptable, capable of handling future upgrades and feature expansions.

Data Collection Methodology

Existing System: Current System in the Cafe Industry

In the cafe and food service industry, many establishments still rely on traditional methods for managing customer orders, table reservations, and menu updates. These existing systems may include manual processes, paper-based systems, or outdated digital solutions. Below, we outline the strengths and weaknesses of the current systems typically used by cafes, providing context for why an upgrade to a web-based solution is necessary.

Current System Strengths:

Personalized Customer Service:

In many traditional systems, employees provide direct interaction with customers, offering personalized service that helps build customer relationships. This allows staff to understand customer preferences better and handle specific requests more efficiently.

Simple Ordering Process:

Many cafes still use a paper-based menu where customers can manually choose their food and drinks. The ordering process is straightforward for both customers and staff, especially when orders are not overly complex or large.

Flexibility in Operations:

Manual systems (such as handwritten order slips and chalkboard menus) give cafe owners flexibility in making daily changes to the menu. These changes can be made on the fly without needing to update a software platform.

Low Initial Costs:

The current system (if relying on paper-based or manual methods) does not require upfront investment in software or hardware infrastructure, which can seem cost-effective, especially for smaller businesses.

Current System Weaknesses:

Limited Scalability:

As customer demand increases, the traditional systems struggle to scale effectively. Large orders, multiple customers arriving at once, or simultaneous demands for delivery and dine-in orders can overwhelm staff, leading to mistakes, confusion, and delays.

Inefficient Order Management:

In busy cafes, managing orders manually can become chaotic. Staff often take orders verbally, write them down, and pass them to the kitchen, leading to miscommunication and potential errors, especially during peak times.

Without an integrated system to track order statuses (e.g., when food is ready or when it’s being delivered), the process becomes fragmented and difficult to manage.

Lack of Real-Time Table Availability:

Without a digital table management system, customers may struggle to know whether a table is available or reserved, leading to confusion, double-bookings, and dissatisfaction.

Staff may need to physically check the dining area to confirm availability, leading to inefficiency.

Difficulty in Updating Menus:

For cafes with frequently changing menus, making updates can be time-consuming. Paper menus or manual chalkboard changes are labor-intensive, and errors are common, especially when items are added, removed, or changed.

Inconsistent menu updates may result in customers ordering items that are out of stock, or they may not have the latest price information.

Lack of Customer Feedback Integration:

Many cafes rely on word-of-mouth or occasional surveys for customer feedback. This feedback is often not systematically gathered or analyzed, which prevents cafes from making informed decisions to improve their services.

Customers may have no direct, easy way to share their experiences or suggest improvements.

Operational Inefficiencies and Overburdened Staff:

During peak hours, the cafe staff may become overwhelmed by a high volume of orders, leading to long wait times, mistakes, and unhappy customers.

Without automated systems in place, managing large numbers of customers or deliveries simultaneously becomes a major challenge.

Increased Risk of Errors:

Manual systems increase the risk of human error. Staff might misinterpret customer orders, forget details, or input incorrect information into a register or cash system.

Handwritten orders might be difficult to read, leading to mistakes in food preparation.

Limited Insights and Analytics:

With traditional systems, there is no easy way for cafe owners to access data analytics. The lack of real-time sales reports, customer preferences, and inventory tracking makes it difficult to optimize operations and improve decision-making.

Need for Improvement
